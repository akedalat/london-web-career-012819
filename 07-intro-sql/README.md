# Intro to SQL

1. Install the SQLite Browser if you haven't already [here](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
2. Open the SQLite Browser and click 'File -> Open DataBase'
3. Choose the `chinook.db` file from this repo. This database is open source and maintained by Microsoft (SQL is no fun if you don't have any data)
4. Click the tab that says 'Execute SQL'. Type SQL queries in the box above. Press the play button. See the results of that query in the box below

## Challenges

```

3. Write the SQL to create a table named 'fans' with an autoincrementing ID that's a primary key and a name field of type text

```sql
CREATE TABLE fans (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

4. Write the SQL to alter the fans table to have a artist_id column type integer

```sql
ALTER TABLE fans ADD column artist_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY;
```

5. Write the SQL to add yourself as a fan of the Black Eyed Peas? ArtistId **169**

SELECT * FROM fans WHERE artist_id != 169;
```

7. Write the SQL to display an artists name next to their album title

SELECT fans.name, artists.name from fans JOIN artists ON artists.ArtistId = fans.artist_id;
```

9. Write the SQL to display artist name, album name and number of tracks on that album

```sql
SELECT artists.Name, albums.Title, count(tracks.TrackId) as '# of tracks' FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
JOIN tracks ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
GROUP BY tracks.AlbumId;
```

10. Write the SQL to return the name of all of the artists in the 'Pop' Genre

```sql
SELECT artists.name, genres.Name FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
JOIN tracks ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
